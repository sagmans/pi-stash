# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security reports.**

Report privately via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

<https://github.com/sagmans/pi-stash/security/advisories/new>

If that route is unavailable, email the maintainer listed in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Please include:

- affected version or commit SHA,
- steps to reproduce,
- impact (what an attacker gains),
- whether draft contents or other private data are involved.

**Redact real draft contents.** Stash files may contain sensitive text; never
paste another person's drafts into a report.

You can expect an acknowledgement within 7 days. Fixes are released as patch
versions; reporters are credited in release notes unless they prefer
anonymity.

## Exposed secrets

GitHub secret scanning covers the repository's full Git history and pull
requests. Push protection blocks supported secrets before they enter the
repository.

Report a discovered secret through the private vulnerability reporting link
above, not a public issue. Revoke or rotate the credential immediately; deleting
it from the latest revision does not remove it from Git history. Include the
secret type and affected commit and path, but redact the credential value.

Treat a push-protection alert as real unless verified otherwise. A maintainer may
bypass a false positive only with a recorded rationale. Any future allowlist
entry must match the narrowest practical pattern and document why the matched
value cannot authenticate; blanket file or directory exclusions are not
permitted.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release tag receives security fixes. There is no long-term
support line while the project is at 0.x.

## Scope notes

`pi-stash` stores draft text and persisted temporary images locally under
`~/.pi/agent/pi-stash/` with private permissions (0700 directories, 0600 files)
and never transmits data. Reports about local data exposure, cross-worktree
leakage, unsafe file handling, symlink races, or extension privilege abuse are
in scope.
